## Task 1: Describe the data

1. __What are the min and max lengths (major axis length, given in pixels) of the rice grains?__
> min lenght: 145.3px	, max length: 239.0px	
2. __What is the range of areas between the smallest and largest rice grains?__
> The smallest rice grain has an area of 7551px while the largest has an area of 18913px 
3. __How many standard deviations (std) is the largest rice grain's perimeter from the mean?__
```
The largest rice grain, with a perimeter of 548.4px, is ~2.6 standard deviations (35.6) from the mean (454.2px). 

This is calculated as: (548.4 - 454.2)/35.6 = 2.6
